# GKEY 10K GLTO Hold
Hold a minimum combined of 10K GLTO across Juno + Osmo chain to qualify for GKEY fairdrop 

## Snapshot 1/12
When reviewing snapshots for months 1 and 2 for the GKEY airdrop to holders of at least 10k GLTO, we discovered addresses in month 1 were missing.

Recovering archival data for month 1 would be expensive, impractical, and set other project goals back. Therefore, we have decided to use the month 2 data for both months.

The difference in the amount of distributed GKEY for each individual holder is most likely very small. However, we are sending an extra 100 GLTO to every qualifying holder (in addition to their GKEY) due to the inconvenience.

We plan to send, to all GLTO holders that qualify, their GKEY and 100 GLTO by 10/21/2022.

This only affects the airdrop for holders of 10k GLTO (on Osmosis or Juno networks), and only for month 1. Month 2 (and other data for other GKEY distributions) appears correct. Please let us know if you encounter any issues during the process.

## Snapshot 3
Due to a mistake in the second installment of the airdrop's autosend script, some wallets were "double-sent". Therefore, we adjusted for this in the third installment. As a result, we ended up sending to 2,449 wallets as opposed to the full number: 2,841. Sorry for the inconvenience!
